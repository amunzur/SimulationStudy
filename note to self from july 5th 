where i left off today:

trying to get the overall phenotype for pop1 and pop2. 
problem is dimensions don't match up. 
because they dont match, i cant use the dot function to find the average genotype of the two chromosomes. 
for np.dot to work, # of coloumns of the 1st array and # of rows of the second array must match.
